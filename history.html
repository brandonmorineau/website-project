The Charming Duckling was founded by Adam Smith in the year of 2005. Mr. Smith was always an odd man who had some odd passions. One of which was his
endless collection of rubber duckies. He wanted to share his passion with the rest of the world so he opened up the first "The Charming Duckling" with the name
inspired from the children's tale the ugly duckling. At first people thought that Mr. Smith was crazy to open up such a store with people say how could such a store 
sustain itself with such a niche market. Mr. Smith soon proved all the non-believers wrong when his business boomed especially with the sale of the giant rubber duckies.
